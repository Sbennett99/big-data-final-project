## The Data
- What is it?
  - For the data of this project I decided to use a book that I really enjoyed reading and as a bonus is of decent length comming in at around 400 pages. The name of this book is Eragon by Christopher Paolini

- Where its From
  - I got the PDF of Eragon from [PDF Drive](https://www.pdfdrive.com/eragon-d37470593.html) and used an online [PDF to txt Converter](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/pdf-to-txt/) to get a txt file to process
